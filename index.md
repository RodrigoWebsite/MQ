 **Project Idea**  
Design and simulate a quantum neural network (QNN) that leverages **quantum entanglement** to model correlations in distributed datasets. My goal is to explore how entangled qubits can enhance representational capacity and learning performance in machine learning tasks.

---

 Background & Motivation

Quantum computing enables new computational models using **qubits**, which exist in a superpositions and can become **entangled**, forming non-classical correlations. Machine learning, on the other hand, seeks to identify patterns in data. By combining these domains, **Quantum Neural Networks** (QNN's) may outperform classical models in certain settings by leveraging entanglement to encode richer relationships across inputs. 

This project is motivated by a desire to : 
- Explore how entanglement can code dependencies across distributed features.
- Simulate and analyze QNN to observe how quantum effects influence learning.
- Bridge quantum theory with practical ML (machine learning) techniques.

An extended explanation of complex numbers can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number).

It can be helpful to visualize complex numbers on the complex plane:

Complex numbers can also be represented in polar form as shown below:
